Personal website / playground.

This is a space for me to mess about with things I want
to play with â€“ so yes, the stack is overkill for the
size of the project.

It is based on my
[UniversalJS starter kit](https://github.com/colinmeinke/universal-js)
which uses my
[Universal Redux Router](https://github.com/colinmeinke/universal-redux-router)
as a core component.

Other technologies include
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react),
[Redux](http://redux.js.org),
[Redux Dev Tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools),
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org),
[Express](http://expressjs.com),
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules),
[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss),
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io),
[hot module reloading](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html),
[Babel](https://babeljs.io),
[ES2015+](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0),
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and
[Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli).

Please feel free to use this as you wish, but be
warned I may make fundamental changes with no warning.
