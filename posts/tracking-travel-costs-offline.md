When we set off almost 2 years ago, we didn't know if
our new lifestyle was going to be financially
sustainable. For that reason, I wanted to keep track of
what we spent along the way.

Over the last 657 days I have recorded every single cost of
our trip, in what I like to refer to as the [greatest
spreadsheet of all time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/105Gj-PjuYujC-jr11yRII3QBdbLDnr1y3x_pZ4NwhiQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Okay – I know what you're thinking ... that's pretty cool
Colin. But with every row I add it becomes a little less
maintainable, and takes a little longer to load.

And then there's offline...

## We spent November in Cuba

Cuba is beautiful – *but there ain't no internet*.

coloured but crumbling Cuban wall](/images/post/track-your-travel-costs-baracoa-granma.jpg)

How am I going to record the £0.008 I spent on this
newspaper if I can't access my spreadsheet?

So this wasn't the first time we've been offline on the trip.
But we've never been offline for this long. Normally only ever
for up to a week.

I've experimented with various offline cost-tracking
techniques, including scraps of paper, but settled on Google's
note-keeping app Keep. I then wait until I'm online again to
transfer these notes from Keep to my spreadsheet.

All this to say – *this isn't a great way to be tracking
travel costs*.

## This is my pain point

And if it's my pain point, then it's other people's too. People
travel with budgets and need to stick to those budgets.
Digital nomads need to weigh up how cost effective a location
is to live and work. And I'm not the only person crazy enough
to [keep track of every cost](http://www.neverendingfootsteps.com/2016/02/16/how-much-does-it-cost-to-travel-the-world-for-a-year-my-2015-expenses).

Whilst in Cuba, with this in mind, and with literally nothing
else to do (I have no idea how people occupy their evenings
without the internet), I went about trying to solve this
problem.

Actually, it was so nice to have some time away from the
screen. I think I forgot how much more creative I am without
the constraints of software.

## Announcing unnamed idea #1

The following is a glimpse into my design process for
a cost-tracking app that would make my daily life easier ...
and prettier.

![A double page spread from my sketchbook – left: trying out
different options for the location component. right: the add a
cost view](/images/post/track-your-travel-costs-add-a-cost.jpg)

The **add a cost** view. A cost can be as general or as
specific as you like.

the site for the first time, adding first cost and then

I love it when I don't have to sign up to a product to try
it out. Here you are prompted to add your first cost as soon
as you arrive. When you're done playing, you can then sign
up to save your progress.

The **dashboard** is how you explore cost data. I like the
idea of being able to share your data with other people, so
they can explore it too. Maybe anyone could explore collective
data to see what it costs to live in different places around
the world.

There are options to filter by location, date range,
total/average or category (transport, coffee, noodles – all
the important ones).

## That's all you're getting for now

Mainly because that's pretty much all I've got. I'll keep
posting about each stage of unnamed idea #1's development.
Let's see where this can go.
